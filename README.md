## Setup

Nodegit is pretty amazingly cool, but I had to install it on linux with the follow command.
Should run this before running npm install I guess

    sudo apt-get install g++
    BUILD_ONLY=true npm install nodegit

If you still have errors try installing this package, though this is dubious since it didn't
affect the error that caused me to run it:

    sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
